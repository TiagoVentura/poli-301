## Preparation

You will get the most out of this class if you (1) attend class, (2) do the homework, and (3) engage with the readings.


## Problem sets

*To practice coding in R* you will complete problem sets throughout the semester. Feel free to work together on the problem sets but **you must turn in your own answers.** You cannot work in groups of more than **three** people.


- ✔+: (*22 out of 20*) Assignment is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered correctly. Document is clean and easy to follow. I will not assign these often.
- ✔: (*20 out of 20*) Assignment is mostly complete and most answers are correct. **This is the expected level of performance.**
- ✔−: (*10 out of 20*) Assignment is mostly incomplete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. 


I'll accept problem sets late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that I won't accept late problem sets. 

## Exams

*There will be two exams* covering (1) the first half of the course, especially programming, and (2) the second half of the course, especially causation.

Make-up exams will be given **only** to students with medical or personal emergencies. If an emergency arises, you will need to contact me **before** the exam or you will receive zero credit.
