## Required

- [this video from Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/scatterplots-a1/creating-interpreting-scatterplots/v/correlation-and-causality)

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Directed Acyclical Graphs in Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://scunning.com/cunningham_mixtape.pdf)^[This reading is mathy-er than what we've covered so far. It also features code from STATA, which we don't use. Don't worry about that so much; we will focus on broad concepts/ideas.]
